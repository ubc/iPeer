*Please note that with MySQL 5.7 and later, [the default sql_mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sql-mode-changes) has been changed. Please make sure the following modes are disabled: ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY, STRICT_TRANS_TABLES, NO_ZERO_IN_DATE, and NO_ZERO_DATE.*

Quick Start
---------------------------
If you have `docker` and `docker-compose` environment setup on your machine, you can start running iPeer for testing / development quickly by following these steps.
```
# get the source
git clone https://github.com/ubc/iPeer.git

# change to iPeer directory
cd iPeer

# optionally, checkout the version you wanted to run
# git checkout tags/3.4.4

# pull git submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# use the default database config
cp app/config/database.php.default app/config/database.php 

# pull images and start containers
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d

# open a shell into the app container
docker exec -it ipeer_app bash
# within the container, install any missing packages
composer install
# exit the container
exit

# on host, change the permission of tmp folders
chmod -R 777 app/tmp
# restart containers
docker-compose restart
```
Launch a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to continue the initial setup.

Running with Docker
---------------------------
### Prerequisites
* Internet connection
* [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

### Running

#### Pulling images
Note: if you are planning to do development, you can skip this step.
```
docker pull ubcctlt/ipeer-app
```

#### Edit docker-compose.yml
Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and choose the browser for integration tests
```
- SELENIUM_HOST=selenium-local
- SELENIUM_BROWSER=chrome
#- SELENIUM_BROWSER=firefox
```

#### Running iPeer

Note: if you are planning to develop iPeer and did not run docker pull with above commands, you will need to run `composer install` to install the dependencies and generate database configuration file.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Running iPeer unit tests

- Running unit tests within docker containers with `phing` requires additional libraries to be installed. This can be done by building the `ipeer-app` image with `Dockerfile-app-unittest` which is specific for running test cases:
    - If the containers are up, stop them by running `docker-compose down`
    - Rebuild the `ipeer-app` image with the command `docker-compose build --no-cache app-unittest`
    - Start the containers by running `docker-compose up -d`

- To run the unit tests on containers:
    - On host, run an interactive shell in the unit test app container: `docker exec -it ipeer_app_unittest bash`
    - In the interactive shell, while at `/var/www/html`, run the command `vendor/bin/phing test`
    
#### Running integration tests

- Install PHP Webdriver (https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver) and Sausage (https://github.com/jlipps/sausage) under `vendors` directory.  These are defined as submodules and can be updated by:
```
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
```
- Setup ubc/docker-canvas container (https://github.com/ubc/docker-canvas).  Also create a network bridge to connect the Canvas app and iPeer app containers together
```
    docker network create canvas_ipeer_network
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network ipeer_app
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network ipeer_app_unittest
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network docker-canvas_app_1
```
- Run the Selenium + Firefox (or Chrome) container (need to disable the passthrough feature):
```
    docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -e SE_OPTS="-enablePassThrough false" -e TZ="Canada/Pacific" --name selenium-local --shm-size 2g selenium/standalone-firefox:3.7.1-argon
```
```
    docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -e SE_OPTS="-enablePassThrough false" -e TZ="Canada/Pacific" --name selenium-local --shm-size 2g selenium/standalone-chrome:3.7.1-argon
```
  Or, if needed to see the browser actions, run the debug image instead and expose the VNC server port 5900 to host:
```
    docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 -e SE_OPTS="-enablePassThrough false" -e TZ="Canada/Pacific" --name selenium-local --shm-size 2g selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:3.7.1-argon
```
```
    docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 -e SE_OPTS="-enablePassThrough false" -e TZ="Canada/Pacific" --name selenium-local --shm-size 2g selenium/standalone-chrome-debug:3.7.1-argon
```
  To view the browser, run VNC viewer on host (the default password is `secret`), e.g.:
    `vncviewer localhost::5900`
    
  To view the WebDriver Hub status, open the following URL on the host:
```
    http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
```
- Create a network bridge to connect iPeer, Canvas, and Selenium together
```
    docker network create canvas_ipeer_network_it
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network_it ipeer_app_unittest
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network_it ipeer_web_unittest
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network_it docker-canvas_app_1
    docker network connect canvas_ipeer_network_it selenium-local
```
- To start the integration test, run an interactive shell in the test app container and run the commands in container, e.g.:
```
    docker exec -it ipeer_app_unittest bash    # start an interactive shell to run the following commands
    vendor/bin/phing init-test-db    # preload iPeer db with sample data
    cake/console/cake -app app testsuite app group system    # run all system test cases
    cake/console/cake -app app testsuite app case system/studentSimple    # run a specific test case
```

Running Virtual Development Server
---------------------------
Virtual Environment Setup:

1.  Install VirtualBox at http://virtualbox.org
2.  Install Vagrant at http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
3.  Go to the iPeer root directory in the terminal. Then run the following commands:
    
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
        vagrant box add ipeerbox http://developer.nrel.gov/downloads/vagrant-boxes/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-v20130731.box
        vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
        vagrant up
4.  Go to localhost:2000 in your browser.

Using a different port (the port number must be available on both the virtual and host environment):

1. change the line in file puppet/dev.pp from

        port => 2000,
to (eg. port 8888)
        
        port => 8888,
2. AND change the line in file app/tests/cases/controllers/v1_controller.test.php from
    
        $server = 'http://localhost:2000';
to

        $server = 'http://localhost:8888';

Running Tests:

Go to the iPeer root directory. Then run the following commands
    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/www
    phing test

For more vagrant commands go to http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html.

Running Tests
---------------------------
Integration Tests

Requirements:
* Selenium Server 2.38+
* PHP Webdriver (https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver)
* Firefox

Runing the tests:

    cd iPeer
    cake/console/cake -app app testsuite app group system

It is better not to touch the mouse or keyboard during the tests.

Configuring Caliper
---------------------------


In order to enable Caliper, both `CALIPER_HOST` and `CALIPER_API_KEY` must be set.

`CALIPER_HOST`: Set the Caliper LRS url.

`CALIPER_API_KEY`: API key for sending Caliper events to the LRS.

`CALIPER_BASE_URL`: Optionally set a base url to use for all events. This is useful to help keep statement urls consistent if the url of your instance changes over time or is accessible though different routes (ex http+https or multiple sub-domains). (Uses base url of request by default).

You may optionally override the user default IRI (from `$base_url/users/view/$user_id`) to something more identifiable when setting both `CALIPER_ACTOR_BASE_URL` and `CALIPER_ACTOR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_PARAM`.

`CALIPER_ACTOR_BASE_URL`: Optionally set the actor's homepage to something else. This will be string formated to allow `CALIPER_ACTOR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_PARAM` to be inserted into it (use `%s` where you want the unique identifier to appear). ex: `http://www.ubc.ca/%s`

`CALIPER_ACTOR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_PARAM`: Optionally set the actor's unique identifier using any column from the `user` table (ex: `username`, `id`, `email`). Will be inserted into the `CALIPER_ACTOR_BASE_URL` string.

upgrade from 1.6:

1. copy the ipeer_export folder OUTSIDE of your iPeer 2 folder
2. run it from your browser http://yourserverpath/ipeer_export/ipeer_export.php
3. type the user/pass and whatnot to get the xml file of your database
4. save it for now and continue on to installation of iPeer 2.

iPeer 2 install:

requirements:
mod_rewrite for apache
PHP 4.3.10+ with GD extension
MYSQL 4+
PEAR with XML_RPC module (optional, only needed when using CWL)

1.  run http://yourserverpath/youripeerpath/install   (trailing slash may be required)
1b. create a database in MySql
2.  follow the instructions for the install
2a. if you are upgrading, select UPGRADE and load the xml file there.
--     in install4, make sure you set the absolute path to your path!
3.  once the install is complete, delete controllers/install_controller.php and /ipeer_export directory.

please note:

1. The database config file /app/config/database.php must be writable during installation. 
2. After installation, please make database.php read only. It is VERY important.
3. To change file permission, you may either use a FTP client or do it directly through command line (if you have
shell access to your server. In unix, you may use chmod command to do it)

please report any bugs you find on sourceforge. we can't fix it if we don't know about it.

any suggestion or question? please let us know

troubleshooting:

-if you type http://yourserverpath/youripeerpath/ and you get http://yourserverpath/loginout/login, your mod_rewrite
is not set up properly. make sure the line in http.conf has 'AllowOverride All'.
